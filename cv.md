## About me:
Iâ€™m 34 years old. I am an engineer. 

In 2020, I wanted to change the type of activity of find additional remote work. Interested in website development. From October to December 2020, I took a course on the Tilda program and began to learn the basics of HTML and CSS on my own. From October to December 2021, he completed an intensive course at Innopolis University on the basics of frontend development.

Skills were not enough to change the type of activity. Learning JavaScript was hard. I began to study on my own from the lessons on Youtube. I realized that there was not enough communication and a mentor on this topic, so I signed up for a course at RS-School. I hope that in 6-12 mounths I will learn how to write code in JS and use JS to make my first applications.

## Basics of Skills:
 * GIT
 * HTML
 * CSS

## Code Example:

```

return  a * b
};
```
